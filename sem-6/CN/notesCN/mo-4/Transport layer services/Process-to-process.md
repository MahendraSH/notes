# Process-to-Process Communication

- the first and imporant duty of the transprot layer is to provide process to process communication
- A process is an appication layer entity (running program ) it uses the services provided from transport layer

## process to process vs host to host to communication

- network layer provides host to host communication ( computer level ) the network layer protocol can only transfer the message from source to the destination host however this is incomplete the message needs to be transfered to the correct process

- this is where the transport layer protocol takes and tarnfers the message to the correct process
