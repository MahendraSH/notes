```
The main reason for migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is the small size of the address space
in IPv4. In this section, we show how the huge address space of IPv6 prevents address
depletion in the future. We also discuss how the new addressing responds to some problems
in the IPv4 addressing mechanism. An IPv6 address is 128 bits or 16 bytes
(octets) long, four times the address length in IPv4.
