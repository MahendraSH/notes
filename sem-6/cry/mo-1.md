# Introduction to Symmetric-Key Encipherment:

 * Security Goals, 
 * Cryptographic Attacks, 
 *  Services and mechanism, 
 *  Techniques.


# Traditional Symmetric-Key Ciphers:

  * Introduction,
  * Substitution Ciphers, 
  * Transposition Ciphers.
---------------------------------------
* # Introduction
* In this era of computers and technology, Information is an asset.
* Facebook and Google are collecting data, extracting valuable information about users.
* The information gathered are usually distributed and not stored at a single place.
* This information must be secured from attacks.




---------------------------------------

* ### Security Goals, 
    * confidentiality 
    * intigrity
    * availability

---------------------------------------

* ### Cryptographic Attacks 
    * #### cryptanalytic attacks (attacks are mathematical)
    * #### non-cryptographic attacks (attacks on security goals)
        * Confidentiality (Snooping and Traffic analysis) -- passive attacks
        * Integrity (Modification, Masquerading, Replaying and Repudiation)  --active attacks
        * Availability (Denial of service) --attack attacks
        * passive vs active attacks
